# Problem Information

Link: [242. Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/)

# Understanding

- **Input:**
    - Two character strings, s and t.
    - Length of each ranges in $[1,5 \times 10^4$]
    - Each character in s and t $\in$ lowercase english alphabets
- **Output:** True if `t` is an anagram of `s` else false or vice-versa

# Approach(es)

- Re-constructing `s` from `t`
    - String stored using array vs linked list
- If both are made up of same characters and each character has same frequency
    - sorting
    - some efficient dynamic set with dictionary operations
